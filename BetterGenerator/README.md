About:

The better generator is a minecraft world generator that aims to be better then the default one. It aims to have more extreme mountains, better plains for building, more logical ore distribution,and many other exciting terrain features.


What's in the folders?

BiomeGenerator - Everything pertaining to biomes
BlockPopulators - Well, block populators. Only use bukkit's block populator type when doing something that spans a single chunk.
ChunkGenerators - ChunkGenerators
BukkitPlugin - all of the bukkit-dependent files
Exceptions - java exceptions
NoiseGenerators - All of the noise generators we will use. We don't use bukkit's noise generators because they are bukkit dependent, and that will be a pain if we end up porting it to single player
